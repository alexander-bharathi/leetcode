// Input: nums = [5, 3, 6, 1, 12], original = 3
// Output: 24
// Explanation:
// - 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
// - 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
// - 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
// - 24 is not found in nums.Thus, 24 is returned.
